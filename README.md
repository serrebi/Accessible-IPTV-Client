# Accessible IPTV Client

An accessible IPTV client VibeCoded using wxPython. Just made this for my own use.

## Features

- Fully accessible with all major screen readers on Windows (NVDA, JAWS, etc).
- Supports m3u and m3u_plus playlists.
- Playlist Manager: add, remove, and manage playlists. All playlists are stored in `iptvclient.conf` in the same folder as the executable.
- Supports external media players:
  - VLC (external)
  - Foobar2000
  - Media Player Classic (MPC-HC)
  - Kodi
  - Winamp
- Category/Group navigation: browse channels by group.
- Channel search and filter field.
- Keyboard navigation for everything. Mouse not required.
- Remembers channel and playlist selection after refresh.
- Settings and playlists are always saved in the appâ€™s folder.
- Fast and responsive.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- Python 3.8+
- wxPython
- VLC or any supported player (if you want playback)
- (Optional) Foobar2000, MPC-HC, Kodi, or Winamp

## Installation

```sh
pip install wxpython
```
download the .py or clone. CD,  and run
```sh
python3 ./iptvclient.py
Download and install VLC or other players if needed.

## Building the Executable
Clone this repo, or download the zip. Then

```sh
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile iptvclient.py
```
or if you want to build using the split version
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile main.py
Your `.exe` will be in the `dist` folder.

## Usage

- Run the app.
- Use menus to add or remove playlists (local files or URLs).
- Set your preferred media player in the Options > Media Player submenu.
- Browse channels and groups using the keyboard. Press Enter to play.
- All settings save automatically in `iptvclient.conf`.

## Known Limitations

- Tentative  EPG/TV Guide. It is what it is for now. If you want to help or fork, feel free. EPG is loaded on startup and then it is checked in the background and kept in a sqLite database in the directory where the script, or executable is. Supports XMLTV, and EPG GZ
- No recording or catchup support.
- App opens streams in external player windows, because that's all I need it to do.

## Tips

- Player paths are auto-detected from default install locations, so make sure they are installed first.
-  You are restricted by what the player you choose supports. VLC and Media player classic support a wide variety of formats.

## Support

I wrote this for myself so there isn't really support. Sorry!
